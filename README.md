# Sticky RAP

A simplified PS99 webhook script for discord, works perfectly with Google App Script (free). Can be tailored to any item, any pet, even any API you'd like, though I'd suggest only changing what you understand.

**Customization Options:**

`WEBHOOK_URL` : The Discord webhook URL.

`MESSAGE_ID` : Leave blank for the first run. After the initial message is sent, fill this with the message ID to keep updating the same message.

`API_URL` : The API endpoint to fetch data from, this is prefilled.

`SEARCH_TERM` : The name of the item to search for in the API data.

`EMBED_TITLE` : The title of the embed message.

`IMAGE_URL` : The URL of the image to include in the embed, all you need to do is change the numbers at the end with the desired rblxassetid:// (can be found in `/collection/pets` )

The given example is tailored for the `2024 Gargantuan Gift` though it's easy enough to change.

Thanks!
